# Jerb Interview

## Overview
As a newly minted software consultant for The Gnar Company Inc, you've been tasked with creating an MVP for a simple job posting application. This repo contains a skeleton codebase for creating the product along with material supplied by the client. The task is to perform some basic information gathering and put together a  simple 2-3 page form-based Rails app. There are no solid requirements for how it is architected, but the skeleton already has a database configured and a Vagrant environment included. The client has booked 2-4 hours worth of your time.

## Instructions
The co-founder of JerbyJerbs wants to build out an MVP web-app to validate an idea. JerbyJerbs is a small company that advertises household job services and assigns the jobs to college students. It is currently a manual process where job posters call a phone number, the receptionist takes down the information, then posts it to a white board. JerbyJerbs staff will then manually match up posted jobs to job doers.

This is a multi-phased engagement. The goal of the first phase is to automate the job posting process and allow the receptionist(s) to take down the information and record it in the web-app. The web app should also contain a simple job listing page, ordered by date for job doers to view. The client supplied some basic wireframes which outline the basic flow and data elements. The client supplied wireframes are in the /docs directory.

## Requirements
Create a rails app based on the specifications listed above. You don't need to go overboard BUT a core level of modern development best practices need to be present. The app also needs to look presentable and have a basic level of responsive behavior. The skeleton codebase contains Bootstrap, but any UI framework may be used. The codebase needs to be developed on a separate branch and Pull Requested into the "submissions" branch. Please feel free to ask questions about the project with other Gnar Team Members.

## Getting Started
The skeleton app contains enough gems to get going (feel free to add more) and a Vagrant configuration file. Simply run:

    $ vagrant up
